Code of Conduct
---------------
We vouch that we(Alex Ng Dehe, Duy Quang Nguyen) work on the project together for more than 75% of the time.

I attest that I have written every line of code that I have submitted
and I take full responsibility for the origin of all the code submitted.
In particular, if any of the code was originally written in a previous
semester or another course I will so acknowledge via e-mail to the
grader.
